My team members this week were Adryel Arizaga and Jay Patel. I really couldn't ask for better team members. It was great bouncing ideas of each other and seeing how they thought about the problems differently than I did.

Adryel Arizaga - Adryel was a joy to work with, very supportive, offered helpful suggestions, and was flexible with new ideas.


Jay Patel - Jay was great at communication, very supportive and gave great feedback that helped me to make my code better.
