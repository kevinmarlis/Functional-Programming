CS 5035 Functional Programming notes and projects

#### A. Python 

This folder contains notes on Python typing.

#### B. Haskell 

This folder contains Haskell and Python versions disproving Goldbach's other conjecture.
PythonVersionA attempts is Haskell inspired, but deals with infinite lists in an inelegant way - by stopping them at 6000.
PythonVersionB is slightly faster than VersionA and works by incrementing through odd numbers, checking if they are prime and if not, checking if they satisfy the Goldbach condition (if odd-prime/2 is a perfect square).
The two Lists files compare how infinite lists work in both Haskell and Python.

#### C. Haskell 2

This folder contains implementations of Haskell functions and their counterparts in Python.
